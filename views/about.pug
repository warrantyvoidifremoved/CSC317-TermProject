                    p Rocks! was founded in 2025 by geology enthusiasts fascinated by the beauty and diversity of the earth beneath our feet. From polished gemstones to rugged minerals, we‚Äôve always believed that every rock tells a story millions of years in the making. 
                    p What started as a personal collection has grown into a passion for sharing these natural treasures with fellow enthusiasts, collectors, and curious minds. Today, we source high-quality rocks and minerals from around the world to bring a little piece of Earth‚Äôs wonder into your home.
